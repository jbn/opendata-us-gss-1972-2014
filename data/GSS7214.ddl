#| SDA requires that the first variable be named "CASEID."  |
#| If you have not specified a variable to be used as the   |
#| CASEID variable you will have a CASEID that has a column |
#| and width value of 0. This may be a problem for SDA.     |
#| Please be sure to take this into consideration and       |
#| ensure that a CASEID is properly described.              |
